In a world where it seems that almost everything can be interpreted to have more than one meaning, isn't math a wonderful thing? Even though 6/2(1+2) can be understood in two different ways (and I am old enough to remember the answer being one!), the point is an explicit path is reassuring, and a good practice to follow. 

Feel free to add to code or add comments to suggest improvements.

Thank you
