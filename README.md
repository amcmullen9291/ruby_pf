# ruby_pf

This CLI is to serve as an introduction to regex (regular expressions) by providing the definition and symbol associated with  commonly used regex. The main website used for this glossary, http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0, was parsed using the Nokogiri gem.

The Nokogiri, Colorize, and Open-uri gems were used for this program.
