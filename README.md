# ruby_pf
Ruby CLI portfolio project

This CLI is to serve as a elementray glossary of regexp. terms (regular expression symbols) by providing the definition and purpose of  commonly used regexp, as well and symbol classification attributes. The main website used for this glossary, http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0, was parsed using the Nokogiri gem.

The Gems used for this program include HTTParty, Nokogiri, Colorize, and Open-uri. While HTTParty was used for in the program itself, OpenURI is included in the Gemfile because HTTParty is currently being debugged for not being able to return a Nil value. I did not, however, run into any problems with the gem.
